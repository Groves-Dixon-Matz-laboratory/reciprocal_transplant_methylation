#### SELECT TARGET GENES OF INTEREST ####
#Want genes that show large variation in methylation by MBD-seq data
#Want genes that are interesting
#differentially methylated genes flagged by DESeq
#top Kmes for modules of interest
#mixture of genes from strongly and weakly methylated classes

#for list of genes see excel file bisulfite_seq_metadata.excel



############ DESIGN PRIMERS ############
#grab the lines from the gff that match with the mRNA of interest
#then reduce down to only exons
#then export the slices of the genome 



prot='XP_015747516.1'
grep $prot ref_Adig_1.1_scaffolds.gff3 > ${prot}_slice.tsv
cut -f 1,4,5 ${prot}_slice.tsv > ${prot}_slice_table.tsv

#choose a slice of sequence and plug into zymo bisulfite primer seeker tool: http://www.zymoresearch.com/tools/bisulfite-primer-seeker?message=ok
#blastx the selected sequence to ensure it's what it's annotated as
#record in primers section of gene_to_bisulfite.excel

#a final fasta file of the selected slices there were put into zymo is saved as:
