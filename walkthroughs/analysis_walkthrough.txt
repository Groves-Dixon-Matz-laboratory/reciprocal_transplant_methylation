Steps for analysis of processed MBDseq and Tagseq data

To prepare MBDseq and Tagseq results for these analyess follow steps in MBD-seq_Data_Processing_Walkthrough.txt
From this you should have two counts tables:
	promoter_gbm_counts_p-1000_200.tsv  -- table of MBD-seq read counts for promoters and coding sequences
	all_rnaseq_counts.txt               -- table of tag-seq read counts for coding sequences


With these count tables in hand, run the following scripts in order:


DEseq_unbound_v_flowthrough.R
	Take raw MBDseq counts, estimate absolute methylation by comparing captured and flowthrough samples, save subsetted counts files, plot pieces of figure 1

DEseq_gene_bodies.R
	Test for differential gene body methylation by origin and transplantation
	
DEseq_Tagseq
	Test for differential transcription by origin and transplantation


split_models_gbm.R
	Test for differential GBM for groups subdivided for closer examination of environment and origin effects

split_models_ge.R
	Test for differential transcription for groups subdivided for closer examination of environment and origin effects
	

correlation_with_expression.R
	Look at how GBM and transcription correlate

geCorrs.R
	Look at how GBM and transcription correlate across all genes


DAPC_tagseq_transplant.R
	Run DAPC on transcription data

DAPC_gbm_transplant.R
	Run DAPC on GBM data and correlate with fitness proxies
