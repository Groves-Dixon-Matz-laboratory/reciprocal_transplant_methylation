Steps for analysis of processed MBDseq and Tagseq data

To prepare MBDseq and Tagseq results for these analyess follow steps in MBD-seq_Data_Processing_Walkthrough.txt
From this you should have two counts tables:
	promoter_gbm_counts_p-1000_200.tsv  -- table of MBD-seq read counts for promoters and coding sequences
	all_rnaseq_counts.txt               -- table of tag-seq read counts for coding sequences


With these count tables in hand, run the following scripts in order:


DEseq_unbound_v_flowthrough.R
	Take raw MBDseq counts, estimate absolute methylation by comparing captured and flowthrough samples, save subsetted counts files, plot pieces of figure 1

DEseq_gene_bodies.R
	Test for differential gene body methylation by origin and transplantation
	
DEseq_Tagseq
	Test for differential transcription by origin and transplantation


bisulfite1_initialize.R
	prepare bisulfite data from bismark

bisulfite2_ori_trans.R
	plot differences between groups for bisulfite data and MBDseq for comparison






plot_heatmaps.R
	Build overall correlation heatmaps for tagseq and MBDseq illustrating strong genetic component to both


	


plot_mbd_counts.R








Additional Scripts for analyses not included in publication:

DEseq_promoters
	Test for differential promoter methylation by origin and transplantation
